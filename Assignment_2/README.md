# Assignment 2 - React To-Do List

## 🔧 Description

This is a React-based To-Do List built using **Vite**.  
It allows users to:

- ✅ Add new tasks (input is validated).
- ✅ Remove tasks.
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (with strikethrough).
- ✅ Filter tasks (All, Completed, Incomplete).
- ✅ Sort tasks (Newest First / Oldest First).
- ✅ Persist tasks using **localStorage**.
